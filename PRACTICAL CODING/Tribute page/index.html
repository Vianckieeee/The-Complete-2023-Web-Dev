  <h2> A look at the legendary career of Kobe Bryant:</h2>
  <ol>
    
    <li>(1996) Drafted and Traded
      <p> - With the 13th pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, the Charlotte Hornets selected Kobe Bryant, the teenage phenom from Lower Merion High School in Philadelphia. </p>
    </li>

    <li>(1997) Slam Dunk Contest Champion
      <p> - Bryant was 18 by the time All-Star Weekend rolled around. He didn’t make the team, but he did participate in the Rookie Challenge, and he won the Slam Dunk Contest.</p>
    </li>

    <li>(1999 - 2002) Phil Jackson arrives and the three-peat
      <p> - The Lakers had been a playoff team with Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal, but they hadn’t quite reached championship form. The furthest they’d made it was to the conference finals. That all changed when Phil Jackson arrived.</p>
    </li>

    <li>(2004) Fallout with Shaq
      <p> - Bryant and O’Neal had butted heads since they first teamed up in 1996. Shaq took issue with the style of basketball Bryant played, labeling him “selfish” and a “show off.” </p>
    </li>

    <li>(2005) Phil Jackson returns
      <p> - The Lakers hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson as head coach. He signed a five-year deal, but he wouldn’t stay in the role long. He made it through 41 games before resigning due to poor health. </p>
    </li>

    <li> (2006) Career-high 81 points
      <p> - On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the Toronto Raptors. It’s the second-highest points total in a single game in league history.</p>
    </li>

    <li>(2008) Olympian
      <p> - The United States Men’s Basketball team suffered a humiliating finish in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.</p>
    </li>

    <li>(2008 - 2010) Return to championship form
      <p> - Bryant was already a three-time champion, but he had never won one without Shaq. O’Neal had gone on to win another title in Miami. </p>
    </li>

    <li>(2012) Final Olympic medal
      <p> - Bryant donned the red, white and blue for the final time in 2012. He won his final gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. </p>
    </li>

    <li>(2016) ‘Dear Basketball’/Retirement
      <p> - Bryant spent the rest of his career chasing a sixth NBA title, which would have tied him with Michael Jordan. But injuries plagued him his final few seasons.</p>
    </li>

    <li>(2017) Jersey retirement
      <p> -On Dec. 18, 2017, the Lakers retired Bryant’s jersey numbers. He’d worn No. 8 until 2006, when he changed to No. 24. He’d first worn 24 in high school before changing to 33.</p>
    </li>

    <li>(2018) Oscar
      <p> - In April 2017, Bryant made an animated short film out of his “Dear Basketball” poem. The following March, he added another trophy to his collection. “</p>
