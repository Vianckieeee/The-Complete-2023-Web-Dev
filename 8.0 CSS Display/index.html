<!-- NOTE:
  CSS Display Property
  1. Block - Takes up full width of container and starts on new line.
  2. Inline - Doesn't start on a new line, stays next to other. Also if an elemenet is set to have an inline value you cannot change the height and the width of the said element. It will just use the space that it only need.
  3. Inline-block - have the characteristics of both inline and block, here you can now set the height and width of the element freely.
