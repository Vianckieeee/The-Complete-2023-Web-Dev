  Tag vs. Element
  Tag is the one that composes of an element. Opening tag and closing tag

  while the Element is the wholeness of it.
  it contatines an opening and closing tag, and the content
  Headings start from 1 and ends at 6 only

  By Default all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout
  starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block
